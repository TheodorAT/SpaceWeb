        <h2>The Sun</h2>
        The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly
        perfect sphere of hot plasma, heated to incandescence by nuclear fusion
        reactions in its core, radiating the energy mainly as visible light and
        infrared radiation. It is by far the most important source of energy for
        life on Earth. Its diameter is about 1.39 million kilometers (864,000
        miles), or 109 times that of Earth. Its mass is about 330,000 times that
        of Earth, and accounts for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar
        System. Roughly three quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen
        (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller quantities
        of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron.

        <h2>Mercury</h2>
        Mercury is the first planet from the Sun and the smallest in the Solar
        System. In English, it is named after the Roman god Mercurius (Mercury),
        god of commerce and communication, and the messenger of the gods.
        Mercury is classified as a terrestrial planet, with roughly the same
        surface gravity as Mars. The surface of Mercury is heavily cratered, as
        a result of countless impact events that have accumulated over billions
        of years. Its largest crater, Caloris Planitia, has a diameter of 1,550
        km (960 mi) and one-third the diameter of the planet (4,880 km or 3,030
        mi). Similarly to the Earth's Moon, Mercury's surface displays an
        expansive rupes system generated from thrust faults and bright ray
        systems formed by impact event remnants.
