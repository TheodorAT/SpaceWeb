        <h1>The Solar System</h1>

        <h2>The Sun</h2>
        The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly
        perfect sphere of hot plasma, heated to incandescence by nuclear fusion
        reactions in its core, radiating the energy mainly as visible light and
        infrared radiation. It is by far the most important source of energy for
        life on Earth. Its diameter is about 1.39 million kilometers (864,000
        miles), or 109 times that of Earth. Its mass is about 330,000 times that
        of Earth, and accounts for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar
        System. Roughly three quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen
        (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller quantities
        of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron.

        <h2>Mercury</h2>
        Mercury is the first planet from the Sun and the smallest in the Solar
        System. In English, it is named after the Roman god Mercurius (Mercury),
        god of commerce and communication, and the messenger of the gods.
        Mercury is classified as a terrestrial planet, with roughly the same
        surface gravity as Mars. The surface of Mercury is heavily cratered, as
        a result of countless impact events that have accumulated over billions
        of years. Its largest crater, Caloris Planitia, has a diameter of 1,550
        km (960 mi) and one-third the diameter of the planet (4,880 km or 3,030
        mi). Similarly to the Earth's Moon, Mercury's surface displays an
        expansive rupes system generated from thrust faults and bright ray
        systems formed by impact event remnants.

        <h2>Venus</h2>
        Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is named after the Roman
        goddess of love and beauty. As the brightest natural object in Earth's
        night sky after the Moon, Venus can cast shadows and can be, on rare
        occasion, visible to the naked eye in broad daylight. Venus lies within
        Earth's orbit, and so never appears to venture far from the Sun, setting
        in the west just after dusk and rising in the east a bit before dawn.
        Venus orbits the Sun every 224.7 Earth days. With a rotation period of
        243 Earth days, it takes longer to rotate about its axis than any other
        planet in the Solar System, and does so in the opposite direction to all
        but Uranus (meaning the Sun rises in the west and sets in the east).

      <section class="leftColumn" , style="margin-bottom: 700px">
        <h2>Earth</h2>
        Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object
        known to harbor life. According to radiometric dating estimation and
        other evidence, Earth formed over 4.5 billion years ago. Earth's gravity
        interacts with other objects in space, especially the Sun and the Moon,
        which is Earth's only natural satellite. Earth orbits around the Sun in
        365.256 days, a period known as an Earth sidereal year. During this
        time, Earth rotates about its axis about 366.256 times. Earth's axis of
        rotation is tilted with respect to its orbital plane, producing seasons
        on Earth. The gravitational interaction between Earth and the Moon
        causes tides, stabilizes Earth's orientation on its axis, and gradually
        slows its rotation.

        <h2>Mars</h2>
        Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in
        the Solar System, being larger than only Mercury. In English, Mars
        carries the name of the Roman god of war and is often referred to as the
        "Red Planet". The latter refers to the effect of the iron oxide
        prevalent on Mars's surface, which gives it a reddish appearance
        distinctive among the astronomical bodies visible to the naked eye. Mars
        is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, with surface features
        reminiscent of the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts,
        and polar ice caps of Earth.

        <h2>Jupiter</h2>
        Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar
        System. It is a gas giant with a mass one-thousandth that of the Sun,
        but two-and-a-half times that of all the other planets in the Solar
        System combined. Jupiter is one of the brightest objects visible to the
        naked eye in the night sky and has been known to ancient civilizations
        since before recorded history. It is named after the Roman god Jupiter.
        When viewed from Earth, Jupiter can be bright enough for its reflected
        light to cast shadows, and is on average the third-brightest natural
        object in the night sky after the Moon and Venus.

      <section class="leftColumn" , style="margin-bottom: 600px">
        <h2>Saturn</h2>
        Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the
        Solar System, after Jupiter. It is a gas giant with an average radius
        about nine times that of Earth. It only has one-eighth the average
        density of Earth; however, with its larger volume, Saturn is over 95
        times more massive. Saturn is named after the Roman god of wealth and
        agriculture; its astronomical symbol (♄) represents the god's sickle.
        Saturn's interior is most likely composed of a core of iron–nickel and
        rock (silicon and oxygen compounds). This core is surrounded by a deep
        layer of metallic hydrogen, an intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen and
        liquid helium, and finally, an outer gaseous layer.

      <section class="leftColumn" , style="margin-bottom: 800px">
        <h2>Uranus</h2>
        Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. Its name is a reference to
        the Greek god of the sky, Uranus, who, according to Greek mythology, was
        the grandfather of Zeus (Jupiter) and father of Cronus (Saturn). It has
        the third-largest planetary radius and fourth-largest planetary mass in
        the Solar System. Uranus is similar in composition to Neptune, and both
        have bulk chemical compositions which differ from that of the larger gas
        giants Jupiter and Saturn. For this reason, scientists often classify
        Uranus and Neptune as "ice giants" to distinguish them from the gas
        giants.

        <h2>Neptune</h2>
        Neptune is the eighth and farthest known Solar planet from the Sun. In
        the Solar System, it is the fourth-largest planet by diameter, the
        third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet. Neptune is 17
        times the mass of Earth, slightly more massive than its near-twin
        Uranus. Neptune is denser and physically smaller than Uranus because its
        greater mass causes more gravitational compression of its atmosphere.
        Neptune orbits the Sun once every 164.8 years at an average distance of
        30.1 AU (4.5 billion km). It is named after the Roman god of the sea and
        has the astronomical symbol ♆, a stylised version of the god Neptune's
        trident.
